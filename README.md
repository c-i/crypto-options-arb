Simple streamlit app that calculates and displays put-call parity arbitrage opportunities between crypto options exchanges using REST APIs.  HTTP requests are slow, so this app is only to be used to get a rough idea of spreads.

Requirements: aiohttp, pandas, streamlit

Run from command line: streamlit run C:/{absolute-path-to}/app.py
