Simple streamlit app that calculates and displays put-call parity arbitrage opportunities between crypto options exchanges using REST APIs.  HTTP requests are slow, so this app is mainly to be used to get a rough idea of spreads.

Requirements: aiohttp, pandas, streamlit

To launch the app in command line, navigate to the file directory where the project files are stored use the command: streamlit run app.py
Alternatively, you can run it from anywhere using the absolute path: streamlit run C:/{path_to}/app.py
